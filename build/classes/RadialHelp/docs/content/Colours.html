      <h2>Colours</h2>

    The <tt>Options</tt> &#8594; <tt>Colours</tt> menu item allows the user
    to customise the colours of the graphical output. The
    <tt>Colours</tt> dialog offers different options depending on
    whether the <tt>Density Plot</tt> or <tt>Radial Plot</tt> option has been
    selected in the <tt>Output</tt> menu.

    <h3>Density Plots</h3>

The edge and fill colour of each of the four graphical elements
(KDE, PDP, Histogram and Points) selected in the
<tt>Options</tt> &#8594; <tt>Settings</tt> dialog can be specified.
These colours are transparent so that even if all elements are filled, the
underlying objects remain visible.

    <h3>Radial Plots</h3>

The radial plot input window has one extra column, in which the user can specify
a colour index. This can be used, for example, to show kinetic indicators such as
Dpar or Cl content of fission track data. If the third data column is not empty,
the graphical output will include a colour bar.
This  colour   bar  consists  of   100  steps,  calculated   by  linear
interpolation between the minimum and maximum values of the third data
column.  The minimum and maximum colour can be set by opening the <tt>
  Options</tt> &#8594; <tt>Colours</tt> menu.
