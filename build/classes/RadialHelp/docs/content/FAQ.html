    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
    <b>1. Can I plot more than 1000 ages?</b><br>
     The default number of rows in <tt>Radial/DensityPlotter</tt> is
     capped at 1000. To process larger datasets, please prepare a <tt>.csv</tt>
     input file as explained in <a href="FT.html">this</a> section for 
     Fission Track data, and in
    <a href="Other.html">this</a> section for Other data.
    <p></p>
    <b>2. Why don't the peaks in my mixture model fit the modes?</b><br>
     The mixture modelling uses the algorithms of Galbraith and Green (1993),
     which have been adopted by Sambridge and Compston (1994) or U-Pb dating
     as well. When applied to <tt>Other</tt> data, the model assumes 
     Normal residuals. This is generally <i>not</i> the case for 
     (strictly positive) radiometric ages, causing biased estimates of
     the component ages. To alleviate this problem, it is a good idea
     to apply a logarithmic <a href="Transformations.html">transformation</a>
     prior to the mixture modelling.
    <p></p>
    <b>3. How many peaks to fit?</b><br>
      The algorithms of Galbraith and Green (1993) assume that the true 
      age distribution which underlies the data consists of a number of 
      discrete peaks. This assumption is necessary for reasons of parsimony. 
      In reality, however, discrete events rarely occur in Nature. It is
      important to keep this in mind when using automated algorithms such
      as the <a href="BinomFit.html">Bayes Information Criterion</a>. 
      Given enough data, criteria like this inevitably provide statistical
      justification to fit more peaks. It is generally more informative
      to use a fixed number of peaks or apply the minimum age model.

    <b>4. Can I change the bandwidth of my KDE?</b><br>
      <tt>DensityPlotter</tt> uses the algorithm of Botev et al. (2010)
      to set a default bandwidth. This is just one of literally dozens
      of similar bandwidth selection algorithms, which seems to work
      quite well for geochronological data. Sometimes, however, the
      <i>Botev-algorithm</i> fails to converge, leading 
      <tt>DensityPlotter</tt> to fall back on a simpler algorithm.
      This tends to happen more often for small datasets, and produces
      very smooth and rather uninformative KDE curves. Another situation
      in which one might want to change the default bandwith is when
      comparing multiple age distributions from one and the same dataset.
      Visual comparison of such multi-panel diagrams is much easier
      when a common bandwidth is used. <tt>DensityPlotter</tt>
      allows the user to manually adjust the bandwidth of KDEs as well
      as the binwidth of histograms to account for these situations
      in the <a href="Settings.html"><tt>Settings</tt></a> form.
      In such situations, the user is advised to report the bandwidth 
      in the figure caption.
