      <h2>Scale and Labels</h2>
      
    The <tt>Options</tt> &#8594; <tt>Settings</tt> menu item allows the user
    to customise the visual appearance of the graphical output. The 
    <tt>Settings</tt> dialog offers different options depending on
    whether the <tt>Density Plot</tt> or <tt>Radial Plot</tt> option has been
    selected in the <tt>Output</tt> menu. The settings can be saved by clicking
    the <tt>'save preferences for next time'</tt> checkbox.
    
    <h3>Density Plots</h3>

    Data can be visualised as KDEs, PDPs, histograms and points.
    Any combination of these four elements can be selected by ticking the appropriate boxes.
    Other options in the menu allow the user to specify the size of the
    histogram bins, and to rescale the X-axis.
    Pressing the  <tt>Ctrl</tt>-button while clicking adjusts the vertical
    scale. Thus, it is possible to 'zoom into' the density plot,
    which is useful if one is interested in a minor peak of a particularly 'spiky'
    distribution. The X-axis labels can be scaled and shortened using a multiplier
    which is automatically calculated if the <tt>autoscale time labels</tt> option is selected.
    This option is turned on by default for fission track data, and off for <tt>Other</tt> data.

    <p>
    The <tt>Settings</tt> panel allows the user to select which combination of
    density estimators are to be included in the graphical output as either line 
    drawings or filled polygons:
    <ul>
        <li>Kernel Density Estimate (KDE, turned on by default)</li>
        <li>Probability Density Plot (PDP, turned off by default for reasons given by Vermeesch, 2012)</li>
        <li>Histogram (turned on by default)</li>
    </ul>
    The values of the individual data points may be plotted by a combination of:
    <ul>
        <li>Points: circles showing the values ignoring their analytical uncertainty</li>
        <li>Ticks: vertical lines whose length is proportional to the analytical precision</li>
        <li>Bells: curves indicating the analytical error distribution of the individual measurements</li>
    </ul>
    The <tt>Settings</tt> form also allows the user to specify the bandwidth
    of the KDE if so desired (the automatic algorithm of Botev et al. 2010 is used
    by default).

    <h3>Radial Plots</h3>

The radial plots use a  circular  scale.  The  default  values for  the
minimum, maximum and central values (z<sub>0</sub>) can be changed in the <tt>
  Options</tt> &#8594;  <tt>Settings</tt> menu. Using  a common
radial scale for  different samples facilitates their intercomparison.
The <tt>Settings</tt> menu also  contains a checkbox  for adding
labels to the data points,  providing an interpretive link between the
data table and radial  plot. Single-grain ages and their uncertainties
can  be determined  by clicking  anywhere on  the radial  plot window.
Pressing the  <tt>Ctrl</tt>-button while clicking  adjusts the horizontal
scale.

<p>
The upper left corner of the  output window shows a data summary, including
the  central  age and  age dispersion. This is  an arguable better estimator of central
tendency than the  arithmetic mean, because it takes  into account the
lognormal nature of N<sub>s</sub>/N<sub>i</sub> and most age distributions.

<h3>Markers</h3>

Sometimes external age constraints are available which complement the data plotted
on a radial or density plot. For example, the depositional age of a sedimentary
deposit may be known, or a fission track dataset may be complemented by a U-Th-He 
age. These external age constraints can be plotted alongside the data as marker lines.
The positions of the markers can be entered in the <tt>Settings</tt> menu as a
sequence of numbers separated by commas, semi-colons, colons, dashes, spaces, underscores 
or plusses.
