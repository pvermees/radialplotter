    <h2>Area normalisation of density estimates</h2>
        
    In studies involving multiple samples, it is useful to normalise
    the area under the density estimates to a common value.
    The area under the KDE is reported in the <tt>Options</tt> &#8594; 
    <tt>Settings</tt> menu. When the <tt>normalise</tt> checkbox
    is selected, the areas under the KDE, histogram (and PDP) are normalised
    to the same value. In this case, the default histogram binwidth is reduced.
    This value can, of course, be changed to any other value.
    The area value can be accessed from the command line, facilitating the
    generation and intercomparison of multiple samples.
