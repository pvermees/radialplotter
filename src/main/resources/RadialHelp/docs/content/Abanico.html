      <h2>Abanico Plots</h2>

Although radial plots are the only sensible way to simultaneously
visualise the value and precision of quantitative datasets, they are
perceived by some as difficult to interpret and therefore inaccessible
to the uninitiated.  To alleviate this concern, it is useful to
combine the radial plot with a probability density estimate. This
combination of graphical devices is sometimes called an 'abanico
plot'. 

<p></p>
To produce an abanico plot, select <tt>Options</tt> &#8594;
<tt>Output</tt> &#8594; <tt>Radial Plot</tt> followed
by <tt>Options</tt> &#8594; <tt>Settings</tt>, and mark
the <tt>abanico</tt> check box. This will generate a Kernel Density
Estimate (KDE) which will be plotted along the radial scale on the
right side of the output window. The bandwidth of the KDE can either
be calculated automatically using the algorithm of Botev et
al. (2010), or set to any other value in the text box which will
appear in the <tt>Settings</tt> window once the <tt>abanico</tt> check
box has been selected. Note that for low precision data such as
fission tracks, it may be useful to extend the minimum and maximum
values of the radial scale in order to see the entire KDE, rather than
just the central part of it.

<p></p>
<tt>RadialPlotter</tt> slightly adjusts the plot dimensions to prevent
overlapping labels and symbols. The position of the data points relative 
to the radial scale and its labels can be further improved by holding 
the <tt>Ctrl</tt>-button while clicking the left mouse button in the 
output window.
