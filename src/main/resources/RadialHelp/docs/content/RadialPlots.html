      <h2>Radial Plots</h2>
      
      Radial Plots are bivariate (x<sub>j</sub>,y<sub>j</sub>) scatterplots where:<br>

with  z<sub>j</sub>  a  transformation  of  some data  and  <font face="symbol">s</font
>(z<sub>j</sub>)  the
corresponding  measurement  uncertainty.   For  example,  if  z<sub>j</sub>  =
log(t<sub>j</sub>)  then  &#963;(z<sub>j</sub>)   =  &#963;(t<sub>j</sub>)/t<sub>j</sub>.   
z<sub>0</sub>  is  a
convenient central  value such as the  weighted mean.  The  slope of a
line  connecting the origin  (x=0,y=0) of  a radial  plot with  a data
point (x<sub>j</sub>,y<sub>j</sub>)  equals z<sub>j</sub>,  and the horizontal  distance along
x-axis  is  a  measure  if  its  precision.   Thus,  the  radial  plot
simultaneously  visualises a  measurement's value  and  precision.  No
other  graphical method  achieves this  goal with  the  same elegance.
This  makes the  radial  plot  the method  of  choice for  visualising
heteroscedastic data, i.e.  data with (large and) variable measurement
uncertainties.   Traditional applications  in the  Earth  Sciences are
fission track  and luminescence dating, which are  governed by Poisson
processes (e.g.,  Galbraith, 1988, 1990; Galbraith et  al., 1999).  In
principle, however, radial plots can be used for any kind of data.
